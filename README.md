# Intro to AngularJS

## Course description

In the last few years, AngularJS has become one of the most popular front-end JavaScript frameworks for building fast and maintainable web apps. It's now widely used in production, ranging from small single-page apps to high-volume features on Google, Virgin America, HBO, MSNBC, Nike, Urban Outfitters, & more. In this workshop split over two evenings, learn the basics of how to get started with developing Angular apps and scaling them with further complexity. We'll use lots of demos to show practical applications of the framework's features, and students will leave the class with a portfolio of introductory Angular projects.
